Add the `DialogPrimitive` component, which is the same as the [`Dialog` component in radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog). You can use it by importing it from the `/alpha` path.

```tsx
import {
  DialogPrimitive,
  DialogPrimitiveClose,
  DialogPrimitiveContent,
  DialogPrimitiveDescription,
  DialogPrimitiveOverlay,
  DialogPrimitivePortal,
  DialogPrimitiveTitle,
  DialogPrimitiveTrigger,
} from '@channel.io/bezier-react/alpha'
```
